# MineSweeper
This is a classic minesweeper we all know from old versions of Windows, with refreshed graphics.<br> 
Created using JavaFx but on the branch <code>swing</code> there is a discontinued version created 
in Swing. (looks more old-fashioned)<br> 
I'm also planning to introduce classic MineSweeper like theme. (Winows 95-XP)
